# Sign-Up Form Project

## Introduction

This project is a practice exercise to apply new skills learned in recent lessons. It involves building a sign-up form for an imaginary service, focusing on HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and functional layout.

## Assignment Overview

### Step 1: Setup and Planning
- Initialized a Git repository to manage the project.
- Created HTML and CSS files with placeholder content to verify proper linking.
- Downloaded the full-resolution design file to understand the layout requirements and overall structure.

### Step 2: Gather Assets
- Selected a high-quality background image for the left sidebar section (sourced from Unsplash).
- Chose an external font ("Norse Bold") for the logo section to match the design style.
- Used the Odin logo image as part of the sidebar branding.

### Step 3: Implementation Notes and Tips
- The background behind the "ODIN" logo uses a semi-transparent dark overlay to improve text readability over the image.
- The "Create Account" button is styled with a green tone (#596D48) to harmonize with the background.
- Input fields have a default light gray border (#E5E7EB).
- Password inputs show a red border when invalid using the `:invalid` CSS pseudo-class.
- Inputs display a blue border and subtle black shadow on focus using the `:focus` pseudo-class.
- Responsive design and JavaScript form validation for password matching are not included, as they are covered in later lessons.
